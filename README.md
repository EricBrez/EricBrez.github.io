### Introduction / Self Assesment
 The computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University provided me with a comprehensive introduction to the field. While I encountered challenges in various areas of study, my perseverance and commitment to learning enabled me to successfully master the coursework, laying the foundation for my skills and knowledge in computer science. Currently, I am focusing my career aspiration on embedded systems, an area where I am eager to expand my capabilities. My primary programming language is C++, and I have also developed proficiency in Java and Python with additional experience in JavaScript and TypeScript.
 
Doing my schooling online, there were limited opportunities for academic collaboration on projects and I became very proficient in working autonomously and managing my time to meet deadlines and accomplish tasks. My experience in the U.S. Army and advancing in my current vocation from a Global Security Operations Center Operator to a Lead Operator to a Supervisor has also ingrained strong leadership and teamwork skills and has allowed me to grow in my ability to manage people and communicate effectively with both internal and external customers, part of which is demonstrated in my example code review listed below.

A major focus of my continuous improvement has been security. For example, in Project One below I took one of the first programs I built in Java, ported it to C++ (my preferred language) and implemented significant enhancements in data validation and error handling. This focus on security evolved further in Project Three, where I incorporated features to protect against SQL injection attacks.

In addition to C++ being my preferred programming language, my preferred programming paradigm is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP has multiple beneficial traits including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and its potential as a collaborative tool to assist teams in working together more efficiently. These are all powerful programming tools and working with separate classes helps to create structures such as the investment and debt calculation algorithms in Project two. Financial math and working with numbers in general is something that interests me and creating the investment calculator first, then doubling the applicationâ€™s functionality by adding the debt calculator was a fun and challenging exercise that afforded me the opportunity to work with ASCII art, formatting, and creating algorithms for performing complex calculations.

To conclude, the projects in my portfolio demonstrate my progression throughout the computer science program. By displaying projects from early on in my studies and recent enhancements, I have emphasized the significant improvements in code structure, organization, and my working knowledge of software engineering principles; and while my practical experience with formal developmental methodologies is limited, I have a solid theoretical understanding of approaches like Agile and Scrum, and I am eager to apply these concepts in real-world settings. These projects highlight my growth in key areas such as secure programming and object-oriented programming. Now having completed the degree program, I am excited to apply these skills in embedded systems development. I look forward to every opportunity to continue growing and learning, particularly in areas that align with my career goals and passions. With my strong foundation in computer science principles and my commitment to ongoing learning, I am ready to make meaningful contributions to the field of computer science.
